# Realtime Crypto information
A usecase of websocket in a single page application, which shows updates from the back-end, without requests from the front-end.

# Why Crypto
The market is open 24/7, unlike stock market that is open only during working hours and working days, so the live example can be working.

# How to run
Using your favorite package manager (I used `pnpm`), install the dependencies and run `run dev`.
For example:

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
